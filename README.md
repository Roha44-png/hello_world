# hello_world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

I am 50 years old of age, I am a Maori female and a Grandmother of 7 Grandchildren.
I am also a stay at home parent of my own younger children who are in my full-time care.
I would not be here if it wasn't for my children.
My home is Aotearoa a small country far away from the rest of the big wide world.
